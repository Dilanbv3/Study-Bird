## 6. Validation & Quality Assurance

### Risks 
* Firstly, the main risk at hand is that users would not feel the need to use Study Bird as they may not have enough reasons to switch from their current study assistant platform which in this case would be Moodle. To mitigate this risk as the developers of Study Bird and students ourselves we not only brain stormed about features we would want in an Study Bird but also utilized surveys and interviews to get a general idea of what studnets feel the need to have in their study assistant platforms, through the requirements that we have gathered which mainly consist of features that students answered heavily in favor of we have a clearer vision of what to implement however this would be done incrementally and prototypes would be developed and given to a range of students in order to test out, through monitoring of their activity and their personal feedback.

* Secondly, with many features it begins to pose an issue to the platform and making sure they all work together and hand in hand is one of the risks that we face. Therefor, throughout the develpment of Study Bird while keeping feasible with the time frame and abilities with the implementation of each feature the system must be prototyped and tested before proceeding onto implementing another feature in order to know which features might pose risks and how to swiftly fix the issue, rather than implementing them all together and running into an issue and being unable to efficiently resolve the issue.
