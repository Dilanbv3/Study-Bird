## 6. Validation & Quality Assurance

### Risks 
* Firstly, the main risk at hand is that users would not feel the need to use Study Bird as they may not have enough reasons to switch from their current study assistant platform which in this case would be Moodle. To mitigate this risk as the developers of Study Bird and students ourselves we not only brain stormed about features we would want in an Study Bird but also utilized surveys and interviews to get a general idea of what studnets feel the need to have in their study assistant platforms, through the requirements that we have gathered which mainly consist of features that students answered heavily in favor of we have a clearer vision of what to implement however this would be done incrementally and prototypes would be developed and given to a range of students in order to test out, through monitoring of their activity and their personal feedback
