## 1. Requirment Elicitation process 

### 1.1 Techniques Used
We used two elicitation techniques to gather information from potential users and stakeholders:

1. Online Survey: 
Distributed via Google Forms to students all over erbil aimed to understand study habits, challanges and desired features.

2. Interviews:
Conducted one-on-one interviews with stuudents both from UKH and other universities to get deeper insights.

### 1.2 Summary of findings
-Most students struggle with staying motivated and not getting distracted.
-Flashcards, weekly quizzes, study reminders and progress charts were the most requested features.
-90% of students think they would benifit from weekly quizzes to help retain information and they are interested in managing how often they take the quizzes.
-81% of students were intreasted in study reminders and to-do lists with real time alerts.
-Students are intreasted in tracking how long they've been studying but only 45% are intreasted in sharing their progress with other peers while the rest prefer to keep it private.
-Students are intreasted in redeeming points for gift cards and/or in app customization features.
